    "## Background\n",
    "Public transit agencies have pursued service expansions and frequency improvements to attract riders, yet many U.S. cities experienced stagnation or decline in ridership in the years leading up to COVID-19. A Congressional Research Service review notes that despite major capital investments (including rail expansions), overall ridership fell in many large markets, and new rail lines do not necessarily increase total system ridership– sometimes shifting resources away from bus networks that carry a large share of trips.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"ref1\">1</a></sup> At the same time, multiple competitive and behavioral forces changed the travel market: cheaper gasoline, rising fares, telework, and the growth of alternative modes like bikeshare and ride-hailing.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"ref1\">1</a></sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prior work\n",
    "Recent empirical work suggests that transit supply improvements can raise ridership, but the net outcome depends on the broader context. Erhardt et al. (2022) quantify ridership change across U.S. metropolitan areas pre-pandemic and find that while expanded transit service and land-use changes would have increased ridership, these gains were outweighed by other factors—especially ride-hailing along with higher fares, higher incomes, more teleworking, higher car ownership, and lower gas prices.<sup><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"ref3\">3</a></sup> Complementing this, Graehler et al. (TRB 2019) document mode-specific ridership declines in major U.S. cities since the mid-2010s and enumerate commonly cited explanations including service cuts, deferred-maintenance reliability issues, micro mobility growth, and Transportation Network Company(TNC) expansion(Uber/Lyft); their panel analysis finds that standard factors (service levels, gas price, auto ownership) do not fully explain the recent declines and reports negative associations between years-since-TNC entry and bus/heavy-rail ridership.<sup><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"ref2\">2</a></sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation for this project\n",
    "While “increase frequency” is a widely recommended lever, agencies operate under budget constraints where additional service hours have opportunity costs. Tabassum et al. (2025) identify strategies used by 12 “successful” U.S. agencies that grew ridership from 2010–2019, including service expansion and improvements(beyond frequency including cleanliness and timeliness) among other supporting policies (e.g., pricing/parking constraints, targeted incentives, outreach).<sup><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"ref3\">3</a></sup> This motivates a productivity-focused question: whether there exists a practical headway threshold (e.g., ≤15 minutes) after which additional frequency yields diminishing returns when evaluated as ridership per unit of supplied service. Building on the above literature, we will test for non-linear (threshold) relationships between frequency/headway and a service-productivity metric (e.g., riders per service hour: Passenger Miles Traveled(PMT)/Vehicle Revenue Hours(VRH)), while accounting for confounders such as car ownership, fare changes, and the presence of ride-hailing and other competing modes.<sup><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"ref3\">3</a></sup>\n",

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.

    "\n",
    "> The datasets we are planning to use are directly from the public transit agencies. Due to the data being transit operations rather than individual user behavior, the traditional need for consent is not applicable. So I would say that the public transit riders may implicitly consent to data collection through the transit systems terms of use\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> Collection biases that we may come across are those who evade transportation fares. They would not be counted in the ridership counts. However, I believe that this group would be negligible when compared to the overall ridership population. With this in mind, conclusions will always be estimations. Bias’s that would matter more is at what time the data is taken, COVID era would be an outlier due to the changes during that year. Along with bus ridership during school and when school is out would affect the ridership counts.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> The data set that we are using does not have any personally identifying information. It consists of information such as aggregate ridership counts and schedule data.\n",

    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> The dataset does not include any demographic information such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Which would limit our ability to mitigate or even test for those factors, but also means that sensitive information is not at risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> The data is from public agencies and public accessible and contains no personally identifiable information, there is no need for more security measures beyond ethically using the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> To reduce any blind spots, we are planning on drawing from multiple sources across agencies that do transportation in San Diego, which consist of San Diego County Metropolitan Transit System (SDMTS), North County Transit District (NCTD) and more. Using multiple sources will help validate findings and capture the bigger picture\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> We know that there is a risk of our sources being biased which would make our data biased. Socioeconomic factors could influence ridership patterns, as a more transit-dependent community may respond differently to frequency changes than less dependent riders. If fare data is involved, we can normalize based on the area’s cost of living. Another factor to consider is the more heavily populated areas and high traffic places, may generate more ridership data. We will do our best to account for this by avoiding over generalizing any findings especially to those highly dense routes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Data with personal identifiable information was not collected, nor is it necessary for analysis, and thus will not be used or displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",

    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Data used is sourced from multiple references, which helps reduce the possibility of discrimination, both directly and through proxy. However, there is concern for bias by income or socioeconomic class when looking at fares and the rider population. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Yes, optimized metrics such as fare costs compared to cost of living does not have any apparent unintended effects. Additional metrics can include the local cost of gas, local parking prices, and/or drivability of surrounding areas.\n",

    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Our results are purely for informational purposes, not designed to be capable of harm. If harm through misrepresentation or misinterpretation were to arise, we can address the concerns on a case by case basis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Deletion or unpublication of our model can be easily done if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">As our model is purely informational, the primary risk for unintended uses or abuse comes from possible misinterpretations and/or misapplications of our results (such as using our data to justify slowing transportation in lower income neighborhoods). Once deployed, we can monitor the use and citations of our analysis.\n"

    "* *Decision Making*\n",
    "    * A blunt but polite tone will be used within our team, members are expected to treat one another and their ideas with the same care and respect they wish to recieve.\n",
    "    * Decisions will be made by majority vote, though every member's concerns will be considered. Decisions made in constrained time frames or without the input of all team member will be followed up with at a later time, though unilateral decisions are discouraged.\n",
    "* *Contribution*\n",
    "    * Specializations will be sorted when more of the project is flushed out; these specializations will be fluid and dependant on what each member feels most comfortable doing.\n",
    "    * If a member of the group is struggling with something they promised to do, they must reach out to the group at the earliest possible time. Group effort reallocation will be decided on a case by case basis.\n",
    "* *Conflict*\n",
    "    * Communication is greatly encouraged, whether there is a problem with the project, the group, or individual members. This can be done through open conversations with an open mind on the group Discord or Imessage.\n",
    "    * If a problem with a teammate arises, open communication comes first, either one on one or as a group. If problems continue, the professor would be notified."
